### Introduction to Arithmetic Expressions

Below are a few examples of simple arithmetic expressions:
1. **Addition**: `2 + 3 = 5`
2. **Subtraction**: `7 - 4 = 3`
3. **Multiplication**: `6 * 5 = 30`
4. **Division**: `20 / 4 = 5`
# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers.
(3*4) + 5  # Expected result is 17


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
hours
